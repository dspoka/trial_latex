This is the intro to the paper.   Here we describe what the whole paper is
about at a high level.  We give the reader some basic idea of why the paper
is addressing an important problem, and what it is, in brief, that we
have to say about it.   We really want the reader to be very interested,
so this paragraph has to be written especially well.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:Background} describes background that a reader needs
to know to appreciate our contribution.  A survey of related
work is either included here, or broken out into a separate section.
Section~\ref{sec:Results} describes our results, including a
description of our experimental measures, the hypotheses we were
testing, and the results of our data.  Finally,
Section~\ref{sec:ConclusionsAndFutureWork} presents a summary of our
conclusions and suggestions for future work.
