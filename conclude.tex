We have presented results of a study of this, that and some other thing.
Here we recap the major results, and their signficance for human progress
towards self-actualization as a species.

Future work may include repeating the experiment conducted in this
paper over future offerings of the course, to lend even more
statistical support to our claims, as well as investigating some ideas
that we've come up with in the meantime that we think will be even
better.
